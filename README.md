Hello, Iâ€™m @stephaniemay and I am currently a Junior at Louisiana State University working on a degree in Computer Science
with a focus in Data Science and Analytics, along with a minor in Business Administrations. I have a thorough understanding 
of Java, Python, and HTML, and intro-level experience in CSS JavaScript, and C#. I also am proficient in Microsoft Word, Powerpoint, 
and Excel. I am looking to pursue areas of problem-solving and pattern recognition within my Data Science focus, and want to continue
to do hands-on work for first-hand experience. I also have a good bit of experience in Software Engineering as that was my focus for
my first two years at LSU. 

I have had some job experience in this field with working with Electronic Arts from May 2021 - August 2021, and I will be working with 
Textron Industries for a Summer 2022 nine week long internship. To see some of the works I have collaborated on, you can check out the 
links below, and to see more projects I have done, feel free to check out my repositories. If you would like to contact me, email me at stephanie.e.mayberry@gmail.com.
